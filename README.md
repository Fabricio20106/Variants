<sup> For Variants 1.16.4 â€” 1.5.X </sup>

Variants is a mod that adds variants of items, blocks and entities to the game. Although other mods also do this (like Wood Good), Variants tries to keep things original by adding features not in those mods.

This mod adds features ranging from new tools and armors, crops, ingots, ores, and even Soul Blaze Rods.

This branch was an attempt to start a port to Minecraft 1.7.10, but it didn't even have code for 1.7. Instead, it has very old code for a 1.16.4 version.
