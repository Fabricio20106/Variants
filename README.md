# Variants
Variants adds various variants of items, blocks, and features from Minecraft.

This branch of the project is to preserve the code of the 1.16 versions.

But since I didn't have any recent 1.16 code at hand, I had to download an old
version of the mod and would need to update it until it matches the latest 1.16 build.

Then I downloaded the ```fabric-1.17``` branch and got to work adding and polishing all features from the commits that followed, a good example being the pots.

Currently, this branch includes features not available in the main project, for example:

- Wool Sweaters with good coloring & appearance in the creative menu;
- Poisoning effects from pots;
- And various polishing touches from the way I program today.
