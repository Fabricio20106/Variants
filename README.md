<sup> For Variants 1.16.4 â€” 1.5.X (yes, it isn't for Fabric 1.17) </sup>

Variants is a mod that adds variants of items, blocks and entities to the game. Although other mods also do this (like Wood Good), Variants tries to keep things original by adding features not in those mods.

This mod adds features ranging from new tools and armors, crops, ingots, ores, and even Soul Blaze Rods.
